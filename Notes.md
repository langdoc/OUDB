We will create two different types of ELAN files:

1. ELAN files without linked audio
  * a) they come from FLEx
  * b) they come from the transcription files without annotations
2. ELAN files with linked audio
  * a) they come from Zs√≥fia's transcribed recordings and have also related FLEx annotations
  * b) they come from a few other, old recordings and have also related FLEx annotations

### 1a)
FLEx-to-ELAN script needed, time alignment in ELAN not needed

### 1b)
1. restructure the text file
2. import into ELAN, time alignment not needed

### 2a)
FLEx-to-ELAN script needed, merging with original time alignment in existing ELAN files needed

### 2b)
FLEx-to-ELAN script needed, new time alignment in ELAN needed
